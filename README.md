# CaesarCipher
The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter of the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, if the shift was 3, then A would be replaced by D, B would become E, and so on. The cipher is named after Julius Caesar, who allegedly used it to communicate with his generals during battle.
